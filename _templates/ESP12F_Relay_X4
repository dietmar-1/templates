Headers must be soldered and jumpers needs to be installed for enabling relays. 

One blue LED is directly on ESP12-F and is intern connected to GPIO 2. In this template it's a LedLink (WIFI connect) as an example.<br> 
The second blue LED is on the Board (D14) ist connected to GPIO 5. In this template it's a PWM LED driver as an example.<br> 
The board uses GPIO16 and so Relay1 is always turned ON when power is applied to the board, causing a brief on/off pulse on the relay as Tasmota loads and turns it off again. Of course, if the last state was ON, then it will stay ON. It's still a very useful board at a bargain price; just a shame the designer was too lazy to route a different GPIO pin.
